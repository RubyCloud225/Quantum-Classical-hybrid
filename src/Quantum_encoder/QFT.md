# Hamiltonian Encoder/Decoder Notes- Quantum Frontier Transform

## 1. State Preparation

Encode input into a Gaussian-like packet ψ0​(x)
Use qubits to represent discrete positions (grid).

## 2. Hamiltonian Evolution

Propagate via U(t)=e−iHt/ℏ
This yields 𝜓1 at later time t1


## 3. Measurement Strategy

Momentum basis via QFT → measure distribution in bands ±ω₀.

Estimate correction parameter 𝑝corr from centroid or filtered mean.

## 4. Correction Operators

### Phase kick (momentum correction):
  Ukick​=e−ipcorr​x^/ℏ

→ changes direction of propagation.

### Translation (position correction):

T(a)=e−iap^​/ℏ

→ shifts distribution back to reference frame.

## 5. Anti-Wave Mirror Concept

Build an “anti-wave” from ψ(x,t;p0,−).

Use it as a symmetric reference to cancel drift.

Correction step = weighted combination: ψ1,corr​≈ψ1​−21​(ψ1​−ψ0​)+21​ψ1,anti​
	​


### 6. Decoder Stage

Apply inverse unitaries (inverse QFT, undo phase kicks/translations).

Recover data in position basis with reduced drift/uncertainty.
