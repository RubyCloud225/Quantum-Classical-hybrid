# Hybrid Quantum-Classical Diffusion Model
### Pre-Seed R&D Opportunity

---

## Project Summary

We are building a **modular, simulation-ready, hybrid quantum-classical architecture** that combines qubit circuit encoding, quantum compression, diffusion transformers . This explores a Quantum native generative model that
solves the currently limitation on hardware. 

As the hardware becomes more advanced, we could move to a fully quantum model.
