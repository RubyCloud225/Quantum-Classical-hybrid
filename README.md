# Algorithm Overview

I‚Äôm building a hybrid system that combines **classical AI** with **quantum-inspired methods** to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and robustness. Unlike traditional pipelines, my design adds a **quantum encoder + compression stage** up front and a **refinement/error-correction loop** at the end, which together reduce cost, improve accuracy, and make the model more production-friendly.

This project is an **active work in progress**. My goal is to show how quantum-inspired representations can reshape the **economics of AI** by delivering stronger performance with fewer resources.

# Pipeline Breakdown

### 1) Raw Data ‚Üí Tokenization
I convert raw input into tokens‚Äîstructured units the rest of the system can handle consistently.

### 2) Quantum Encoder (Graph / Qubit-Style Encoding)
I encode tokens into a **graph-like, qubit-inspired state** (e.g., parameterized gates and entanglement structure).  
This creates a compact, information-dense representation with two aims:
- Preserve salient structure while enabling **reversible** mapping back to the original domain.
- Expose **topology** (graph structure) that downstream components can compress and reason about.

### 3) Quantum-Inspired Compression & Pruning
I apply compression on the encoded graph/state to remove redundancy (e.g., pruning weak edges/entanglements and merging equivalent substructures) while tracking fidelity metrics.  
Result: a **smaller, cheaper latent** that retains the signal I care about.

### 4) Latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT, Classical Core)
I run a diffusion-style transformer **in latent space**.  
Operating on the compressed representation lets the model:
- Capture long-range dependencies efficiently.
- Train/infer with **lower compute and memory** than raw-space approaches.

### 5) Quantum Decoder Layer (Back to Graph/State)
I map the DiT‚Äôs latent back onto the quantum-style graph/state so I can:
- Enforce **cycle-consistency** with the encoder.
- Recover structure needed to reconstruct outputs or pass to downstream tasks.

### 6) Error Estimation & Refinement Loop
I estimate reconstruction error (and diffusion noise mismatch) and run a **controller (RNN-style)** to adjust encoder/decoder/compression parameters.  
This **closed loop** reduces artifacts, stabilizes training, and improves final accuracy over successive passes.

### 7) Output Reconstruction
I decode the refined graph/state back to the target domain, producing the final output.

# Why This Matters

- **Efficiency:** Compressing before modeling means fewer FLOPs, less memory pressure, and faster training/serving‚Äîwithout sacrificing accuracy.  
- **Scalability:** The latent+graph approach scales to larger datasets and longer contexts with **sub-linear cost growth** relative to raw-space methods.  
- **Resilience:** Noise injection plus the error-correction loop makes the system more robust to imperfect or shifting data.  
- **Differentiation:** Blending **latent diffusion** with a **quantum-style encoder/decoder** and **graph compression** goes beyond classical pipelines.

### Business Impact (What this unlocks)
- **Lower infra cost per task:** More throughput on the same hardware footprint.  
- **Faster iteration cycles:** Shorter experiment loops, enabling quicker product improvements.  
- **Deployability:** A smaller, more stable model is easier to operate, monitor, and scale in production.  
- **Defensibility:** The hybrid architecture and compression+refinement loop create clear technical differentiation that‚Äôs hard to replicate.
